Git Security Policy
1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a comprehensive security policy for the use of Git version control. This policy is designed to protect our intellectual property, prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities, and ensure the integrity and traceability of our codebase. Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all individuals and automated systems that interact with our Git repositories.

2. Scope
This policy applies to all Git repositories, branches, and codebases owned or managed by the organization, as well as all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors with access to these repositories.

3. Core Principles
Principle of Least Privilege: Users and systems must only have access to the repositories and branches they require for their specific roles.

Integrity of Code: All changes to the codebase must be properly reviewed, tested, and tracked to ensure the integrity of the final product.

Confidentiality: Sensitive information, including credentials and proprietary data, must never be committed to a Git repository.

Accountability: All changes must be traceable back to the individual who made them.

4. Key Policy Areas
4.1. Access Control

Repository Access: Access to repositories must be granted on a need-to-know basis and requires approval from the team lead or a designated manager.

Role-Based Access: Access levels (read, write, admin) must be assigned according to a user's role and responsibilities.

SSH Key Management: All SSH keys used for Git access must be protected with a strong passphrase and revoked immediately upon an employee's departure.

Personal Access Tokens (PATs): PATs must have the minimum necessary scope, an expiration date, and be stored securely in a secrets manager.

4.2. Branching and Merging

Protected Branches: The main (or master) branch and other stable release branches must be designated as protected branches.

Merge Request/Pull Request (MR/PR) Requirements:

No direct commits are allowed to protected branches. All changes must be submitted via an MR/PR.

All MRs/PRs must require at least two approvals from authorized reviewers (e.g., team members who did not author the code) before they can be merged.

All changes must pass automated Continuous Integration (CI) checks, including unit tests and linting, before being eligible for review.

Feature Branches: All development work must be done on dedicated feature or topic branches, which are then merged into the main branch via an approved MR/PR.

4.3. Commit and Code Quality

Clear Commit Messages: All commit messages must be clear, concise, and descriptive, providing context for the changes made.

No Binary Files: Large binary files (e.g., images, videos, large data sets) must not be committed directly to the repository. Use a separate asset management system or Git LFS (Large File Storage) if absolutely necessary.

Static Code Analysis: A static code analysis tool must be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for security vulnerabilities, bugs, and code quality issues on every MR/PR.

4.4. Sensitive Information

Credentials and Secrets: Under no circumstances are API keys, passwords, database credentials, or any other secrets to be committed to the repository, even in encrypted form. Use a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager) for handling secrets.

Credential Scanning: A credential scanning tool must be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively detect and block commits containing hardcoded secrets.

4.5. Code Signing

GPG Signing: All commits to protected branches must be cryptographically signed using a GPG key. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the commit history, preventing unauthorized changes or impersonation.

Commit Verification: The CI/CD pipeline must be configured to verify the signature of all commits before they are merged into protected branches.

5. Auditing and Monitoring
Activity Logs: All Git activity, including pushes, merges, and access changes, must be logged and monitored for suspicious behavior.

Regular Audits: Regular audits of repository access, branch protection rules, and commit history must be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.

6. Policy Enforcement
Violations of this policy will be addressed on a case-by-case basis and may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to, revocation of repository access. All personnel are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy. Any security concerns or potential policy violations should be reported immediately to a team lead or security officer.
